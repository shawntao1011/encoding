This is a blog for documenting encoding related experience.

One import difference between linux and windows is the default encoding. Linux is way easy to use since the encoding is uniformed as utf-8, while Windows encoding varies a lot(e.g gb18030).



The blog is realized using a normal git-page method but structed like gitbook, since online publishing and search engine are both required.

The gitbook template is modified from [He Tao's project](https://github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook).
